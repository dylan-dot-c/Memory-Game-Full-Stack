# Clever Amnesia Project

Version 2.0.0

-   API updates (changed from using nodeJS + ExpressJS + SequelizeORM + MySQL for the backend and changed to supabase and postgresDB)
-   Added TypeScript
-   backend folder is now obselete but I will let it stay

Simple full stack project that was first built with React, JavaScript and TailwindCSS on the frontend and nodeJS + ExpressJS + SequelizeORM + MySQL on the backend.

Now i have removed the backend folder and all that and have used supabase as a way to work with my backend
