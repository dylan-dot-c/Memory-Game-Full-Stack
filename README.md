# Clever Amnesia

This is one of my first fullStack projects that I actually deployed!
Clever Amnesia is just a simple memory game where playes flip cards and try and match them up.
The interesting part is that it measures your time and the number of flips it takes you to win the game, also it comes with 3 levels of difficulty: easy, medium and hard.
Here I used React+Vite+TailwindCSS for the frontend
and EXPRESS+SEQUELIZE+MYSQL for the backend.
Both API and Database were deployed using railway!
